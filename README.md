## Origin
English reading not only broadens my knowledge, but brings me lots of fun as well. However, I do look up some words again and again without even noticing the repeating behavior, which obviously reduces the effiency and hardens the English learning curve. I ask myself is it possible to track the search results conveniently and perhaps help me to memorize these word definitions in an easier way? 

Therefore, I created this online tool to store search results automatically every time after I am done with the searches. Combined with customizable settings for layout, I manage to provide a complete solution for reading experience.
